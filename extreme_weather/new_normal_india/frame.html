<meta name="description" content="Floods in Kerala were a rude reminder that once-in-a-century rain can happen more frequently and hit us with greater intensity. Nagaland, which has witnessed one of the driest monsoons till recently, suddenly finds itself in the list of flood-hit states. This anomaly has several faces. Sometimes it manifests itself in the form of unprecedented storm season, which battered large parts of the country, killing more than 500 people ahead of the monsoon. That, again, is linked to a climate anomaly%4increasing temperature and heat wave incidents. According to IMD, 2017 was the fourth warmest year on trot after 2014, 2015 and 2016. In the same year, even western Rajasthan, primarily a desert, experienced flood due to excess rainfall. We look back at the last two decades to understand the scale, spread and frequency of such events">
